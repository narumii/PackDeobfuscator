### WHAT IS REVERSE ENGINEERING (RE)?
***
Reverse engineering is taking apart an object to see how it works in order to duplicate or enhance 
the object. The practice, taken from older industries, is now frequently used on computer hardware 
and software. Software reverse engineering involves reversing a program's machine code (the
string of 0s and 1s that are sent to the logic processor) back into the source code that it was 
written in, using program language statements.
